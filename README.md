heya this is only public for easy access, feel free to have a look around...

this is my nixos config with "stand alone" home home-manager on the same flake as the rest of the system, theres nothing stopping you from breaking it and its inputs out into another flake but i was having issues with asyncronous updating of packages,

nixvim can be run with "nix run ." while its flake is above you in the dir tree
